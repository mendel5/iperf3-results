Results of iperf and iperf3

## Bandwidth

After testing my connection with iperf3 I was wondering if my results are good and what a good/ acceptable bandwidth looks like. I found the following references:

```
Proving the Network is Not the Problem With iperf

From the output above we see that the lowest observed throughput within a one-second interval was 927 Mbps, with an average rate of 939 Mbps. These numbers approach the maximum practical throughput for a 1 Gbps Ethernet link, and strongly suggest that the network is not at fault.

Iperf testing. What is considered a good result on a Gigabit network?

You should get around 940 Mbps if everything is working properly and you don't have any bottlenecks.
